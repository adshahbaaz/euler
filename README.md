## Introduction

This repo documents my solutions to project euler problems in `C`. The idea is to 
test both my understanding of math and the `C` programming language, having just finished reading `K & R`. 

The solutions aim to be optimal and elegant - however, in cases where the optimal solution is verbose and the cost of brute forcing it is minimal, I choose the brute force approach.
