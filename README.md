## Introduction

This repo documents my solutions to *Project Euler* problems in `C`. The idea is to 
test both my understanding of math and the `C` programming language, having just finished reading `K & R`. 

I have strived to write optimal and elegant solutions, but in cases where the optimal solution is verbose and the performance cost of brute forcing it is minimal, I choose the brute force approach. This being C , all programs should take $< 0.5s$.
